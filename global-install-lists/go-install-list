# Why the hell Go has no sensible way to install and list system installed
# packages is beyond me, but it looks like they're going through a lot right now
# I guess, so whatever. After installing `go` from Homebrew, here are the shell
# commands you have to copy paste to make Doom Emacs's go module happy. Good
# luck regenerating this file; I had to just dump my shell history in here to
# make this one. Maybe someday they'll fix `go list all` and I'll put that here.
#
# An astute observer might notice that gocode is not in this list even though
# doom doctor still wants it (at the time of this writing). This is intentional;
# gocode is deprecated and I have the go lsp module enabled which should more
# than take its place.
